Explanation of Code:

The HTML code contains a form with four input fields. The first input field is a number input that requires the user to specify the desired password length. The second and third input fields are checkboxes that allow the user to include symbols and numbers in the password. The fourth input field is a submit button that sends the form data to the PHP script.

The PHP script begins by checking if the form has been submitted via POST. If it has, it retrieves the user's desired password length and whether they want to include symbols and/or numbers. It then initializes three variables: $available_chars, $available_symbols, and $available_numbers. $available_chars is initialized with all lowercase and uppercase letters of the alphabet.

If the user wants to include symbols, the $available_chars variable is appended with the $available_symbols string. If the user wants to include numbers, the $available_chars variable is appended with the $available_numbers string.

The script then initializes a $password variable to an empty string.

A for loop is used to iterate through the desired password length. During each iteration, a random character is selected from the $available_chars string and appended to the $password variable.

Once the loop has finished, the generated password is displayed to the user.

This project utilizes several array functions such as strlen() and rand(), string functions such as .= for string concatenation, date/time functions are not used in this project but PHP has them
